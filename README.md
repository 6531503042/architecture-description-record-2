# Title
2. Implementing gRPC for Real-Time Data Processing

## Context
Q: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

A: **Our project requires real-time data processing capabilities to handle large volumes of data efficiently. We need a technology that can support this requirement.**


## Decision
Q: What is the solution that we're proposing and/or doing?

- **Implement gRPC for real-time data processing between services.**
- **Leverage gRPC's bidirectional streaming for efficient data transfer.**

## Rationale
Q: Why do we choose this solution?

**A: We choose this solution for several reasons:**
- **Real-time Processing:** gRPC's bidirectional streaming allows for real-time data processing, enabling us to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Efficiency:** gRPC's efficient serialization and multiplexing support improve performance for real-time applications.
- **Scalability:** gRPC's support for HTTP/2 enables scalable and reliable communication for real-time data processing.


## Consequences
